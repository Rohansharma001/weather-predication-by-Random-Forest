This project focuses on predicting weather conditions (such as Rain: True/False) using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. The model is trained on historical weather data including parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and rainfall indicators. Random Forest, an ensemble learning method, builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. The trained model provides reliable and accurate weather forecasts, supporting data-driven decision-making in agriculture, transportation, and daily planning

Short Version (Resume / Dashboard)
A machine learning–based weather prediction system using the Random Forest algorithm to classify rainfall conditions based on historical weather data.

🔹 Technical Version (Documentation)
The Random Forest classifier is applied to preprocessed weather data, handling missing values and feature scaling. Multiple decision trees are trained on random subsets of data and features, and final predictions are generated through majority voting. The model achieves high accuracy and robustness compared to single-tree models.
